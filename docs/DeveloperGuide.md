### Application Architecture, Overview, Offer, Contact, and Help Features

**Author:** Navaneethan Sanjai

#### 1. Main Control Flow & Architecture

`InternTrackr` is the entry point of the application. It ties together the core components and keeps the main loop running until the user decides to exit.

**1.1 Application Startup**

When the app launches, the `InternTrackr` constructor sets up three things: `Ui`, `Storage`, and `ApplicationList`.

* It tries to load any previously saved data from disk via `Storage`.
* If the file doesn't exist yet (e.g. first launch) or the data is corrupted, an `InternTrackrException` is caught internally. The app then starts fresh with an empty list and lets the user know via `Ui`.

![Startup Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiStartupSequence.png)

**1.2 Main Command Loop**

After startup, `run()` kicks off the read-parse-execute loop, which keeps going until an `ExitCommand` flips the `isExit` flag to true.

* **Happy Path:** The user types a command, it gets parsed and executed, and the result is shown on screen.

![Run Loop Happy Path Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiRunLoopHappyPath.png)

* **Error Path:** If the command is unrecognised or the arguments are malformed, an `InternTrackrException` is thrown. The loop catches it and calls `Ui#showError()` — the app stays running rather than crashing.

![Run Loop Error Path Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiRunLoopErrorPath.png)

#### 2. UI Component

The `Ui` class owns all terminal interaction — nothing else in the app touches `System.in` or `System.out` directly.

* **Responsibility:** Reading user input via `readCommand()`, and printing messages, dividers, and errors via `showMessage()` and `showError()`.
* **Design Rationale:** Keeping all I/O in one place means commands stay decoupled from the console entirely. This makes writing automated tests much simpler — you just redirect the streams once in test setup and you're done.

#### 3. Overview Feature Implementation

The `overview` command gives users a quantitative snapshot of their internship applications, including a detailed analytics breakdown by stage.

**Implementation Details:**

The feature is handled by `OverviewCommand`, which extends the abstract `Command` class. Here's what happens when it runs:

1. It queries `ApplicationList` for the current application count.
2. It iterates through the list, aggregating the frequencies of each application state (e.g., Applied, Pending) using a `LinkedHashMap` to maintain order based on `Application.VALID_STATUSES`.
3. It passes this data to `Ui` to format and display the analytics summary.
4. Since it's a read-only operation, it never touches `Storage`.

![Overview Command Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiOverviewCommandSequence.png)

**End-to-End Execution:**

The diagram below shows the full flow — from the user typing `overview` all the way to the output appearing on screen.

![End-to-End Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiEndToEndSequence.png)

#### 4. Offer Feature Implementation

The `offer` command enables users to track their compensation packages while automating the workflow of updating application statuses.

**Implementation Details:**

1. The command takes in the target index and the numerical salary.
2. `OfferCommand#execute()` verifies the index bounds.
3. It updates the `salary` field of the selected `Application`.
4. It checks the application's current status. If the status is not already "Offered", it normalizes and updates the status automatically.
5. `Storage#save()` is triggered immediately to ensure financial data is persistently written to disk.

![Offer Command Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiOfferCommandSequence.png)

#### 5. Contact Feature Implementation

The `contact` command allows users to store recruiter details directly alongside a specific application, keeping networking information localized.

**Implementation Details:**

1. The command takes in the target index, the contact name (prefixed by `c/`), and the contact email (prefixed by `e/`).
2. `ContactCommand#execute()` verifies the index bounds against the `ApplicationList`.
3. It updates the internal state of the selected `Application` with the provided name and email.
4. `Storage#save()` is triggered immediately to ensure these networking details are securely written to disk and persist across sessions.

![Contact Command Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiContactCommandSequence.png)

#### 6. Help Feature Implementation

The `help` command is designed to provide users with direct assistance without cluttering the CLI environment.

**Implementation Details:**

The `HelpCommand` invokes `Ui` to display a hardcoded URL to the exhaustive online User Guide. This delegates documentation tracking to the web rather than bloating the internal executable with large text blocks.

#### 7. Deadline List Feature Implementation

The `deadline list` command allows users to view all deadlines associated with a specific application.

**Implementation Details:**

1. The command takes in the target index.
2. It retrieves the corresponding `Application` from `ApplicationList`.
3. It accesses the application's associated deadlines.
4. Each deadline is formatted and displayed via `Ui`.

**Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Supporting multiple deadlines per application**

* **Alternative 1 (previous design):** Store a single `Deadline` in `Application`
    * Pros: Simpler implementation
    * Cons: Cannot support multiple deadlines per application

* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Introduce a `DeadlineList`
    * Pros: Supports multiple deadlines and enables future features such as sorting and filtering
    * Cons: Requires refactoring across model, storage, and commands

* **Reasoning:** Internship applications often involve multiple stages (e.g. OA, interviews, offers),
each with its own deadline. Supporting multiple deadlines improves realism and extensibility.

**Notes**

* Index validation ensures safe access to applications
* If no deadlines exist, an appropriate message is shown to the user

<!-- @@author -->

#### 8. Design Considerations

**Aspect: Handling an empty application list during `overview`**

* **Alternative 1:** Throw an `InternTrackrException` to warn the user there's nothing to show.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Display "0 applications" without any fuss.
* **Reasoning:** An empty list is a completely valid state — especially right after first launch. Treating it as an error would just confuse the user unnecessarily.

**Aspect: Passing dependencies to read-only commands (`Overview`, `Help`)**

* **Alternative 1:** Pass a valid `Storage` object to every command for consistency.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Pass `null` for `Storage` when calling read-only commands.
* **Reasoning:** Since `OverviewCommand` and `HelpCommand` never write anything, giving them a live `Storage` reference risks accidental side effects. Passing `null` (guarded by `assert` statements) keeps the execution lightweight and the intent clear.

### Storage, Model, and List Feature Implementation

**Author:** Shyamal

---

#### 1. Storage Component

The `Storage` class is responsible for persisting all internship application data to a
human-editable text file and reloading it when the app starts. This ensures that data
survives between sessions without requiring a database.

**1.1 File Format**

Each application is stored as a single pipe-delimited line in `data/interntrackr.txt`.
There are multiple possible formats depending on the fields present:
```
company | role | status
company | role | status | contactName | contactEmail
company | role | status | contactName | contactEmail | deadlineType | dueDate | isDone 
```
Each application may have zero or more deadlines appended to the end of the line.

This format was chosen because it is human-readable and easy to edit manually,
satisfying the course constraint of using a human-editable storage format.

**1.2 Saving Applications**

When a command modifies the list (e.g. `add`, `delete`, `status`), it calls
`Storage#save()` with the current list. The method writes each application's
`toStorageString()` output as a new line in the file, creating the `data/` folder
if it does not exist yet.

**1.3 Loading Applications**

On startup, `Storage#load()` reads the file line by line and reconstructs
`Application` objects. The method handles two cases:

The method handles variable-length input:

* First 3 fields → `company`, `role`, `status`
* Next 2 fields (optional) → `contactName`, `contactEmail`
* Remaining fields → parsed in groups of 3 as deadlines:
  * `deadlineType`, `dueDate`, `isDone`

The sequence diagram below shows how `Storage#load()` behaves during app startup:

![Storage Load Sequence Diagram](images/ShyamalStorageLoadSequence.png)

The sequence diagram below shows how `Storage#save()` is triggered after a command executes:

![Storage Save Sequence Diagram](images/ShyamalStorageSaveSequence.png)

**1.4 Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Storage format for deadlines**

* **Alternative 1:** Store each application and its deadline as separate lines,
  linked by an index.
  * Pros: Cleaner separation of concerns.
  * Cons: Harder to parse, more error-prone, breaks human-editability.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Inline the deadline fields into the same line
  as the application using additional pipe-separated fields.
  * Pros: Simple to parse, easy to read and edit manually, single source of truth per application.
  * Cons: The line gets longer when a deadline is present, but remains readable.

**Aspect: Handling corrupted data**

* **Alternative 1:** Skip corrupted lines silently and continue loading.
  * Pros: App always starts up even with bad data.
  * Cons: Silent data loss — the user would never know entries were dropped.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Throw an `InternTrackrException` immediately
  and start with an empty list.
  * Pros: The user is explicitly warned that their data file is corrupted.
  * Cons: All data becomes inaccessible until the user fixes the file manually.
  * **Reasoning:** Transparency about data integrity is more important than convenience.
    The text format makes it easy for the user to inspect and fix the file themselves.

---

#### 2. ApplicationList Defensive Design

The `ApplicationList` class manages the in-memory list of applications. Two key
defensive design decisions were made to prevent misuse by other components.

**2.1 Unmodifiable List**

`ApplicationList#getApplications()` returns a `Collections.unmodifiableList()` view
instead of the raw `ArrayList`. This prevents any external caller from directly
adding, removing, or clearing entries without going through the proper methods
(`addApplication()`, `deleteApplication()`), which include bounds-checking and logging.
```java
public List<Application> getApplications() {
    return Collections.unmodifiableList(applications);
}
```

Any attempt to call `.add()` or `.remove()` on the returned list will throw an
`UnsupportedOperationException` at runtime, making misuse immediately visible
during testing.

**2.2 Index Bounds Checking**

Both `getApplication(int index)` and `deleteApplication(int index)` validate the
1-based index before accessing the underlying list. If the index is out of range,
an `InternTrackrException` is thrown with a user-friendly message indicating the
valid range.
```java
if (index < 1 || index > applications.size()) {
    throw new InternTrackrException("Invalid index: " + index
        + ". Please enter a number between 1 and " + applications.size() + ".");
}
```

This prevents `IndexOutOfBoundsException` from propagating up to the user as a
cryptic crash.
          
<!-- @@eugenia-cnl-lee -->         
**2.3 Refactoring Application to support multiple deadlines**

Originally, each `Application` stored only a single `Deadline`.
This design limited the system to one deadline per application.
To support more realistic workflows, the model was extended to allow multiple deadlines per application.

***Rationale***

Internship processes typically involve multiple stages, each with its own deadline
(e.g. online assessments, interviews, offer acceptance).
Supporting only a single deadline restricts usability and prevents implementation of features such as deadline listing.

***Impact***

This refactor required coordinated updates across:
- Model
- Commands
- Storage

Despite increased complexity, this improves extensibility and aligns the system with real-world usage.

**3.1 Implementation**

`ListCommand#execute()` iterates over the `ApplicationList` using 1-based indices
and calls `Ui#showMessage()` for each entry. If the list is empty, a friendly prompt
is shown instead.

**3.2 Design Rationale: Using `Ui` instead of `System.out`**

An earlier version of `ListCommand` used `System.out.println()` directly. This was
refactored to use `Ui#showMessage()` instead, consistent with every other command
in the codebase.

* **Why it matters:** Commands that bypass `Ui` are untestable — you cannot intercept
  or assert on `System.out` output in JUnit tests without capturing streams.
  By routing all output through `Ui`, tests can subclass `Ui` with a capturing
  override (as seen in `DeadlineCommandTest`) to verify output without touching the console.

### Filter, Status, Find and Clear Feature Implementation

**Author:** Emry

### 1. Filter Feature Implementation

The `filter` feature allows users to navigate large lists of applications by isolating entries that match a specific recruitment stage. It also provides a mechanism to reset the view to the full list.

#### 1.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through the `FilterCommand` and `FilterCommandParser` classes. The logic is designed to be case-insensitive and resilient to user input variations.

**1.1.1 Parsing Logic**
The `FilterCommandParser#parse()` method handles the initial input processing:
1.  **Empty Check**: Verifies if arguments exist; otherwise, it throws an `InternTrackrException` explaining the correct usage.
2.  **Reset Detection**: Checks if the argument is exactly `clear` (case-insensitive). If so, it returns a `FilterCommand` with the `isClear` flag set to `true`.
3.  **Prefix Validation**: Ensures status-based filters start with the `s/` prefix.
4.  **Cleaning**: Extracts the status string, removes any accidental quotation marks, and trims whitespace before passing it to the command constructor.

**1.1.2 Execution Logic**
When `FilterCommand#execute()` is called, it performs the following steps:
1.  **Branching**: If the `isClear` flag is active, it immediately calls `handleClearFilter()` to print every application in the list.
2.  **Validation**: For status filters, it queries `Application#isValidStatus()` to ensure the input matches one of the recognized categories: `Applied`, `Pending`, `Interview`, `Offered`, `Rejected`, or `Accepted`.
3.  **Normalization**: It retrieves the "canonical" version of the status (e.g., "iNtErViEw" becomes "Interview") via `Application#getNormalizedStatus()` to ensure a successful match.
4.  **Iteration**: It loops through the `ApplicationList` using a 1-based index.
5.  **Matching**: For each application, it compares the current status with the search term. If they match, the application is passed to the `Ui` for display.
6.  **Edge Case Handling**: If the loop completes and the `matchCount` is zero, it informs the user that no applications currently hold that status.

#### 1.2 Sequence Diagrams

The diagram below shows the interaction when a user inputs a filter command:

![Filter Parsing Sequence Diagram](images/EmryFilterCommandSequence.png)

The diagram below shows the internal logic of the `FilterCommand` during execution:

![Filter Execution Sequence Diagram](images/EmryFilterLogic.png)

#### 1.3 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Normalization vs. Literal Matching**
* **Alternative 1**: Match the user's input exactly against the stored data.
  * *Pros*: Faster execution as no string transformation is needed.
  * *Cons*: If a user types `filter s/applied` but the data is stored as `Applied`, they get zero results, which is counter-intuitive.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Normalize both the input and the comparison target to Title Case.
  * *Reasoning*: This provides a "Search-like" experience where the user does not need to remember exact capitalization, reducing friction.

---

### 2. Status Feature Implementation

The `status` command allows users to update the state of an existing internship application. This is a critical component of the application lifecycle, moving entries from "Applied" toward "Offered" or "Rejected."

#### 2.1 Implementation Details

The `status` feature is handled by `StatusCommand` and `StatusCommandParser`, integrating directly with both the Model and Storage components.

**2.1.1 Parsing Logic**
The `StatusCommandParser#parse()` method breaks down the complex command string:
1.  **Delimiter Check**: It looks for the ` s/` prefix. If missing, it throws an error showing the `status INDEX s/STATUS` format.
2.  **Index Extraction**: It splits the string to isolate the index. It attempts to parse this as an `Integer`; if it fails (e.g., the user typed `status first s/...`), it throws a `NumberFormatException` caught and rethrown as an `InternTrackrException`.
3.  **Status Extraction**: It extracts the string after the `s/` prefix, trimming it for processing.

**2.1.2 Execution Logic**
The `StatusCommand#execute()` method follows a strict validation-then-update pipeline:
1.  **Dependency Assertion**: Uses Java `assert` statements to ensure `ApplicationList`, `Ui`, and `Storage` are not null.
2.  **Bounds Validation**: Checks if the provided index is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `applications.getSize()`. If out of bounds, it provides a user-friendly error message showing the valid range.
3.  **Content Validation**: Rejects empty status strings and checks against the master list of valid statuses (Applied, Pending, etc.) via `Application#isValidStatus()`.
4.  **The Update**: Retrieves the target `Application` object and updates its internal status field with the normalized string.
5.  **Immediate Persistence**: Unlike read-only commands, this command immediately calls `storage.save()`. This ensures that the progress is saved to the hard drive instantly.

#### 2.2 Sequence Diagrams

The following diagram shows the parsing logic for a status update:

![Status Parsing Sequence Diagram](images/EmryStatusLogic.png)

The diagram below illustrates how the command interacts with the Model and Storage components:

![Status Execution Sequence Diagram](images/EmryStatusCommandSequence.png)

#### 2.3 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Validation of Status Strings**
* **Alternative 1**: Allow any text as a status.
  * *Pros*: Users can create custom statuses like "Waiting for HR."
  * *Cons*: Breaks the `filter` command's ability to categorize data and risks making the storage file messy.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Use a strict whitelist of 6 valid statuses.
  * *Reasoning*: By forcing users into a specific workflow, we ensure the data remains structured enough for the `Overview` and `Filter` features to remain accurate and useful.

**Aspect: Auto-Save vs. Manual Save**
* **Choice**: Triggering `Storage#save()` automatically.
  * *Reasoning*: In a CLI environment, users often exit abruptly. Since status changes represent significant time investments (like receiving an offer), losing that update due to a crash or sudden exit is unacceptable. Auto-saving after every update prioritizes data safety.

### 3. Find Feature Implementation

The `find` feature allows users to search for specific internship applications by matching a keyword against company names and roles. This is essential for navigating large lists efficiently.

#### 3.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through the `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser` classes.

**3.1.1 Parsing Logic**
The `FindCommandParser#parse()` method processes the user input:
1.  **Trimming**: It removes leading and trailing whitespace from the argument string.
2.  **Validation**: It verifies that the resulting keyword is not empty. If it is, an `InternTrackrException` is thrown with usage instructions.
3.  **Instantiation**: It returns a new `FindCommand` object initialized with the keyword.

**3.1.2 Execution Logic**
When `FindCommand#execute()` is called:
1.  **Normalization**: The search keyword is converted to lowercase to facilitate case-insensitive matching.
2.  **Iteration and Matching**: It loops through the `ApplicationList`. For each application, it checks if the lowercase company name or lowercase role contains the keyword.
3.  **Result Aggregation**: Matching applications and their original 1-based indices are stored in temporary lists.
4.  **Display**:
  * If no matches are found, a "No matching applications found" message is displayed via the `Ui`.
  * If matches exist, the `Ui` displays each matching application preceded by its original index number from the full list.

#### 3.2 Sequence Diagrams

The diagram below shows the interaction between the Parser, Command, and Model during a find operation:

![Find Command Sequence Diagram](images/EmryFindCommandSequence.png)

#### 3.3 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Search Scope**
* **Alternative 1**: Search only company names.
  * *Pros*: Faster matching and less visual clutter.
  * *Cons*: Users often want to group applications by role type (e.g., searching "Backend") across different firms.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Search both company and role fields.
  * *Reasoning*: Maximizes utility for the user by allowing them to find applications regardless of which detail they remember.

---

### 4. Clear Feature Implementation

The `clear` command allows users to wipe all stored internship applications to reset the tracker for a new cycle.

#### 4.1 Implementation Details

The feature is handled by the `ClearCommand` class and includes a safety confirmation step.

**4.1.1 Execution Logic**
The `ClearCommand#execute()` method follows a strict confirmation-before-deletion workflow:
1.  **Confirmation Prompt**: It displays a warning asking the user to type "yes" to confirm the action.
2.  **Blocking Input**: It calls `Ui#readCommand()` to wait for the user's specific response.
3.  **Response Validation**: It checks if the response is exactly "yes" (case-insensitive and trimmed).
4.  **Data Wiping**:
  * If confirmed, it calls `applications.clear()` to empty the in-memory list.
  * It immediately invokes `storage.save()` to overwrite the data file on disk with the now-empty list.
  * A success message is displayed.
5.  **Cancellation**: If the input is not "yes", the operation is aborted, and a cancellation message is shown.

#### 4.2 Sequence Diagrams

The diagram below illustrates the confirmation loop and subsequent data clearing process:

![Clear Command Sequence Diagram](images/EmryClearCommandSequence.png)

#### 4.3 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Confirmation Mechanism**
* **Alternative 1**: Clear data immediately.
  * *Pros*: Single-step execution for power users.
  * *Cons*: Extremely high risk of accidental data loss, as the command automatically overwrites the storage file.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Two-step confirmation via a sub-prompt.
  * *Reasoning*: Given that `clear` is a destructive and relatively rare operation, prioritizing data safety over speed is the more defensive and user-friendly choice.

### Add, Delete, Parser, Archive and List Archive Feature Implementation

**Author:** Aarav

---

### 1. Add Feature Implementation

The `add` feature allows users to create and track a new internship application by specifying the company and role.

#### 1.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through `AddCommandParser` and `AddCommand`.

**1.1.1 Parsing Logic**

The `AddCommandParser#parse()` method processes the user input as follows:

1. It checks that both the `c/` and `r/` prefixes are present.
2. It identifies the positions of the company and role prefixes, allowing either order in the user input.
3. It extracts and trims the company and role values.
4. It removes accidental quotation marks from the parsed values.
5. If either field is missing or blank, it throws an `InternTrackrException`.

**1.1.2 Execution Logic**

When `AddCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It constructs a new `Application` using the parsed company and role.
2. It checks `ApplicationList#hasApplication()` to prevent duplicate entries.
3. If a duplicate is found, it informs the user and exits without saving.
4. Otherwise, it adds the new application to the list.
5. It shows confirmation messages through `Ui`.
6. It immediately calls `Storage#save()` so the new application is persisted.

![Add Command Sequence Diagram](images/AaravAddCommandSequence.png)

#### 1.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Handling duplicate applications**

* **Alternative 1:** Allow duplicate entries.
  * *Pros:* Simpler logic and more flexibility.
  * *Cons:* Users may accidentally track the same application multiple times, making the list unreliable.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Reject duplicates before insertion.
  * *Reasoning:* This keeps the tracker clean and prevents avoidable user mistakes.

---

### 2. Delete Feature Implementation

The `delete` feature removes an active internship application from the tracker.

#### 2.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand`.

**2.1.1 Parsing Logic**

The `DeleteCommandParser#parse()` method:

1. Verifies that an index is provided.
2. Parses the index as an integer.
3. Rejects non-numeric or non-positive values with an `InternTrackrException`.

**2.1.2 Execution Logic**

When `DeleteCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It resolves the provided index against the active applications only using `ApplicationList#getActiveApplication()`.
2. It finds the same application’s actual position in the full backing list.
3. It removes the application from the backing list using `ApplicationList#deleteApplication()`.
4. It displays a confirmation message through `Ui`.
5. It immediately calls `Storage#save()` so the deletion is persisted.

This design ensures that the index used by `delete` always matches what the user sees in the default `list` output, which excludes archived applications.

![Delete Command Sequence Diagram](images/AaravDeleteCommandSequence.png)

#### 2.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Indexing archived vs active applications**

* **Alternative 1:** Delete directly by backing-list index.
  * *Pros:* Simpler internal implementation.
  * *Cons:* The index would not match the default list shown to users once archived entries exist.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Resolve the index against active applications first.
  * *Reasoning:* This keeps command behavior consistent with the visible list and reduces user confusion.

---

### 3. Parser Implementation

The `Parser` component is responsible for dispatching raw user input to the correct command parser or command object.

#### 3.1 Implementation Details

When `Parser#parse()` is called:

1. It validates that the input is not null or blank.
2. It rejects inputs containing the `|` character to protect the storage format.
3. It splits the input into the command word and argument string.
4. It normalizes the command word to lowercase.
5. It uses a `switch` statement to route the input to the correct parser or command constructor.
6. For commands such as `add`, `delete`, and `archive`, it delegates parsing to `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, and `ArchiveCommandParser` respectively.
7. For `list`, it supports both `list` and `list archive`.
8. If the command word does not match any known command, it throws an `InternTrackrException`.

Unlike `add`, `delete`, and `archive`, `list archive` does not use a dedicated parser class. Instead, `Parser` handles it directly because its parsing logic is simple.

![Parser Sequence Diagram](images/AaravParserSequence.png)

#### 3.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Centralized command dispatch**

* **Alternative 1:** Let each feature perform its own top-level command matching.
  * *Pros:* Each feature is more self-contained.
  * *Cons:* Command routing logic becomes duplicated and harder to maintain.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Use a centralized `Parser` dispatcher.
  * *Reasoning:* This keeps command recognition in one place and makes the overall control flow easier to understand and extend.

**Aspect: No dedicated parser for `list archive`**

* **Alternative 1:** Introduce a separate `ListArchiveCommandParser`.
  * *Pros:* Symmetry with the other commands.
  * *Cons:* Adds another class for very little parsing logic.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Handle `list archive` directly inside `Parser`.
  * *Reasoning:* Since the command only checks whether the `list` argument is `archive`, a dedicated parser would add unnecessary complexity.

---

### 4. Archive Feature Implementation

The `archive` feature allows users to hide an application from the default list while keeping it in storage.

#### 4.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through `ArchiveCommandParser` and `ArchiveCommand`.

**4.1.1 Parsing Logic**

The `ArchiveCommandParser#parse()` method:

1. Checks that an index is provided.
2. Parses the index as an integer.
3. Rejects non-numeric or non-positive values with an `InternTrackrException`.

**4.1.2 Execution Logic**

When `ArchiveCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It resolves the provided index against the active applications using `ApplicationList#getActiveApplication()`.
2. It marks the target application as archived by calling `Application#setArchived(true)`.
3. It shows confirmation output through `Ui`.
4. It immediately calls `Storage#save()` so the archived state is persisted.

Once archived, the application no longer appears in the default `list` output, but it can still be viewed with `list archive`.

![Archive Command Sequence Diagram](images/AaravArchiveCommandSequence.png)

#### 4.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Archive vs permanent deletion**

* **Alternative 1:** Delete rejected or inactive applications permanently.
  * *Pros:* Keeps the list short.
  * *Cons:* Users lose historical records that may still be useful for reference.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Archive applications instead of deleting them.
  * *Reasoning:* This preserves application history while keeping the active list uncluttered.

---

### 5. List Archive Feature Implementation

The `list archive` feature displays all archived internship applications.

#### 5.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through `Parser` and `ListArchiveCommand`.

`Parser` directly returns a `ListArchiveCommand` when it detects the input `list archive`.

When `ListArchiveCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It iterates through the full `ApplicationList`.
2. It counts how many applications are archived.
3. If no archived applications exist, it informs the user.
4. Otherwise, it prints a header and lists each archived application using a separate display index.
5. If an archived application contains a note, the note is displayed underneath it.

This feature is read-only and does not call `Storage#save()`.

![List Archive Command Sequence Diagram](images/AaravListArchiveCommandSequence.png)

#### 5.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Showing archived entries in a separate view**

* **Alternative 1:** Show archived and active applications together in one list.
  * *Pros:* All data is visible in one command.
  * *Cons:* The default list becomes cluttered and less useful for active job tracking.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Keep archived entries in a separate `list archive` view.
  * *Reasoning:* This preserves historical data while keeping the primary workflow focused on active applications.

## Product scope
### Target user profile

University students applying to many internships who want a quick, simple way to track where each application stands, 
without signing up for yet another website, especially those who prefer typing and shortcuts over messy Excel sheets.
