### Application Architecture, Overview, Offer, Contact, and Help Features

**Author:** Navaneethan Sanjai

#### 1. Main Control Flow & Architecture

`InternTrackr` is the entry point of the application. It ties together the core components and keeps the main loop running until the user decides to exit.

**1.1 Application Startup**

When the app launches, the `InternTrackr` constructor sets up three things: `Ui`, `Storage`, and `ApplicationList`.

* It tries to load any previously saved data from disk via `Storage`.
* If the file doesn't exist yet (e.g. first launch) or the data is corrupted, an `InternTrackrException` is caught internally. The app then starts fresh with an empty list and lets the user know via `Ui`.

![Startup Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiStartupSequence.png)

**1.2 Main Command Loop**

After startup, `run()` kicks off the read-parse-execute loop, which keeps going until an `ExitCommand` flips the `isExit` flag to true.

* **Happy Path:** The user types a command, it gets parsed and executed, and the result is shown on screen.

![Run Loop Happy Path Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiRunLoopHappyPath.png)

* **Error Path:** If the command is unrecognised or the arguments are malformed, an `InternTrackrException` is thrown. The loop catches it and calls `Ui#showError()` — the app stays running rather than crashing.

![Run Loop Error Path Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiRunLoopErrorPath.png)

#### 2. UI Component

The `Ui` class owns all terminal interaction — nothing else in the app touches `System.in` or `System.out` directly.

* **Responsibility:** Reading user input via `readCommand()`, and printing messages, dividers, and errors via `showMessage()` and `showError()`.
* **Design Rationale:** Keeping all I/O in one place means commands stay decoupled from the console entirely. This makes writing automated tests much simpler — you just redirect the streams once in test setup and you're done.

#### 3. Overview Feature Implementation

The `overview` command gives users a quantitative snapshot of their internship applications, including a detailed analytics breakdown by stage.

**Implementation Details:**

The feature is handled by `OverviewCommand`, which extends the abstract `Command` class. Here's what happens when it runs:

1. It queries `ApplicationList` for the current application count.
2. It iterates through the list, aggregating the frequencies of each application state (e.g., Applied, Pending) using a `LinkedHashMap` to maintain order based on `Application.VALID_STATUSES`.
3. It passes this data to `Ui` to format and display the analytics summary.
4. Since it's a read-only operation, it never touches `Storage`.

![Overview Command Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiOverviewCommandSequence.png)

**End-to-End Execution:**

The diagram below shows the full flow — from the user typing `overview` all the way to the output appearing on screen.

![End-to-End Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiEndToEndSequence.png)

#### 4. Offer Feature Implementation

The `offer` command enables users to track their compensation packages while automating the workflow of updating application statuses.

**Implementation Details:**

1. The command takes in the target index and the numerical salary.
2. `OfferCommand#execute()` verifies the index bounds.
3. It updates the `salary` field of the selected `Application`.
4. It checks the application's current status. If the status is not already "Offered", it normalizes and updates the status automatically.
5. `Storage#save()` is triggered immediately to ensure financial data is persistently written to disk.

![Offer Command Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiOfferCommandSequence.png)

#### 5. Contact Feature Implementation

The `contact` command allows users to store recruiter details directly alongside a specific application, keeping networking information localized.

**Implementation Details:**

1. The command takes in the target index, the contact name (prefixed by `c/`), and the contact email (prefixed by `e/`).
2. `ContactCommand#execute()` verifies the index bounds against the `ApplicationList`.
3. It updates the internal state of the selected `Application` with the provided name and email.
4. `Storage#save()` is triggered immediately to ensure these networking details are securely written to disk and persist across sessions.

![Contact Command Sequence Diagram](images/SanjaiContactCommandSequence.png)

#### 6. Help Feature Implementation

The `help` command is designed to provide users with direct assistance without cluttering the CLI environment.

**Implementation Details:**

The `HelpCommand` invokes `Ui` to display a hardcoded URL to the exhaustive online User Guide. This delegates documentation tracking to the web rather than bloating the internal executable with large text blocks.

#### 7. Deadline List Feature Implementation

The `deadline list` command allows users to view all deadlines associated with a specific application.

**Implementation Details:**

1. The command takes in the target index.
2. It retrieves the corresponding `Application` from `ApplicationList`.
3. It accesses the application's associated deadlines.
4. Each deadline is formatted and displayed via `Ui`.

**Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Supporting multiple deadlines per application**

* **Alternative 1 (previous design):** Store a single `Deadline` in `Application`
    * Pros: Simpler implementation
    * Cons: Cannot support multiple deadlines per application

* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Introduce a `DeadlineList`
    * Pros: Supports multiple deadlines and enables future features such as sorting and filtering
    * Cons: Requires refactoring across model, storage, and commands

* **Reasoning:** Internship applications often involve multiple stages (e.g. OA, interviews, offers),
each with its own deadline. Supporting multiple deadlines improves realism and extensibility.

**Notes**

* Index validation ensures safe access to applications
* If no deadlines exist, an appropriate message is shown to the user

<!-- @@author -->

#### 8. Design Considerations

**Aspect: Handling an empty application list during `overview`**

* **Alternative 1:** Throw an `InternTrackrException` to warn the user there's nothing to show.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Display "0 applications" without any fuss.
* **Reasoning:** An empty list is a completely valid state — especially right after first launch. Treating it as an error would just confuse the user unnecessarily.

**Aspect: Passing dependencies to read-only commands (`Overview`, `Help`)**

* **Alternative 1:** Pass a valid `Storage` object to every command for consistency.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Pass `null` for `Storage` when calling read-only commands.
* **Reasoning:** Since `OverviewCommand` and `HelpCommand` never write anything, giving them a live `Storage` reference risks accidental side effects. Passing `null` (guarded by `assert` statements) keeps the execution lightweight and the intent clear.

### Storage, Model, List, and Note Feature Implementation

**Author:** Shyamal

---

#### 1. Storage Component

The `Storage` class is responsible for persisting all internship application data to a
human-editable text file and reloading it when the app starts. This ensures that data
survives between sessions without requiring a database.

**1.1 File Format**

Each application is stored as a single pipe-delimited line in `data/interntrackr.txt`.
The format is as follows:
company | role | status | contactName | contactEmail | salary | note
company | role | status | contactName | contactEmail | salary | note | deadlineType | dueDate | isDone ...

- The first 7 fields are always present. Fields with no value are stored as `-`.
- Each deadline appends 3 additional fields: `deadlineType`, `dueDate`, `isDone`.
- Multiple deadlines are supported by repeating the 3-field group.

This format was chosen because it is human-readable and easy to edit manually,
satisfying the course constraint of using a human-editable storage format.

**1.2 Saving Applications**

When a command modifies the list (e.g. `add`, `delete`, `status`), it calls
`Storage#save()` with the current list. The method writes each application's
`toStorageString()` output as a new line in the file, creating the `data/` folder
if it does not exist yet.

**1.3 Loading Applications**

On startup, `Storage#load()` reads the file line by line and reconstructs
`Application` objects. To keep the method readable and follow SLAP,
the parsing logic is split into focused helper methods:

- `parseLine()` — coordinates field extraction and delegates to helpers
- `parseStatus()` — validates and normalizes the status field
- `parseSalary()` — parses the optional salary field
- `parseNote()` — parses the optional note field
- `parseDeadlines()` — reconstructs `Deadline` objects from remaining fields

Any line with fewer than 7 parts, an unrecognised status, an unparseable date,
or a malformed salary throws an `InternTrackrException` with the corrupted line
number for easy user diagnosis.

The sequence diagram below shows how `Storage#load()` behaves during app startup:

![Storage Load Sequence Diagram](images/ShyamalStorageLoadSequence.png)

The sequence diagram below shows how `Storage#save()` is triggered after a command executes:

![Storage Save Sequence Diagram](images/ShyamalStorageSaveSequence.png)

**1.4 Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Storage format for optional fields**

* **Alternative 1:** Store each application and its optional fields (deadline, note, salary)
  as separate lines linked by an index.
  + Pros: Cleaner separation of concerns.
  + Cons: Harder to parse, more error-prone, breaks human-editability.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Inline all fields into the same pipe-delimited line,
  using `-` as a placeholder for absent values.
  + Pros: Simple to parse, easy to read and edit manually, single source of truth per application.
  + Cons: Lines grow longer with more fields, but remain readable.

**Aspect: Handling corrupted data**

* **Alternative 1:** Skip corrupted lines silently and continue loading.
  + Pros: App always starts up even with bad data.
  + Cons: Silent data loss — the user would never know entries were dropped.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Throw an `InternTrackrException` immediately
  and start with an empty list.
  + Pros: The user is explicitly warned that their data file is corrupted.
  + Cons: All data becomes inaccessible until the user fixes the file manually.
  + **Reasoning:** Transparency about data integrity is more important than convenience.
    The text format makes it easy for the user to inspect and fix the file themselves.

---

#### 2. ApplicationList Defensive Design

The `ApplicationList` class manages the in-memory list of applications. Two key
defensive design decisions were made to prevent misuse by other components.

The class diagram below shows the relationships between the key classes in this author's section:

![Class Diagram](images/ShyamalClassDiagram.png)

**2.1 Unmodifiable List**

`ApplicationList#getApplications()` returns a `Collections.unmodifiableList()` view
instead of the raw `ArrayList`. This prevents any external caller from directly
adding, removing, or clearing entries without going through the proper methods
(`addApplication()`, `deleteApplication()`), which include bounds-checking and logging.
```java
public List<Application> getApplications() {
    return Collections.unmodifiableList(applications);
}
```

Any attempt to call `.add()` or `.remove()` on the returned list will throw an
`UnsupportedOperationException` at runtime, making misuse immediately visible
during testing.

**2.2 Index Bounds Checking**

Both `getApplication(int index)` and `deleteApplication(int index)` validate the
1-based index before accessing the underlying list. If the index is out of range,
an `InternTrackrException` is thrown with a user-friendly message indicating the
valid range.
```java
if (index < 1 || index > applications.size()) {
    throw new InternTrackrException("Invalid index: " + index
        + ". Please enter a number between 1 and " + applications.size() + ".");
}
```

This prevents `IndexOutOfBoundsException` from propagating up to the user as a
cryptic crash.

---

#### 3. ListCommand and UI Abstraction

**3.1 Implementation**

`ListCommand#execute()` iterates over the `ApplicationList` using 1-based indices
and calls `Ui#showMessage()` for each entry. If the list is empty, a friendly prompt
is shown instead. If an application has a note, it is displayed indented on the
next line beneath the application details, only when non-null and non-blank.

**3.2 Design Rationale: Using `Ui` instead of `System.out`**

An earlier version of `ListCommand` used `System.out.println()` directly. This was
refactored to use `Ui#showMessage()` instead, consistent with every other command
in the codebase.

* **Why it matters:** Commands that bypass `Ui` are untestable — you cannot intercept
  or assert on `System.out` output in JUnit tests without capturing streams.
  By routing all output through `Ui`, tests can subclass `Ui` with a capturing
  override (as seen in `DeadlineAddCommandTest`) to verify output without touching
  the console.

The sequence diagram below shows the full flow of the `list` command:

![List Command Sequence Diagram](images/ShyamalListCommandSequence.png)

---

#### 4. Note Feature Implementation

The `note` command allows users to attach free-text insights to a specific
internship application. This is useful for recording interview impressions,
tech stack requirements, or any other application-specific details that do not
fit into the structured fields.

**4.1 Implementation Details**

The feature is implemented through `NoteCommand` and `NoteCommandParser`.

**4.1.1 Parsing Logic**

The `NoteCommandParser#parse()` method processes the user input as follows:

1. **Blank Check:** Verifies the argument is not null or blank; throws an
   `InternTrackrException` if so.
2. **Prefix Check:** Verifies the ` n/` prefix is present; throws an
   `InternTrackrException` if missing.
3. **Split:** Splits the argument on ` n/` to separate the index and note content.
4. **Content Check:** Verifies the note content is not blank.
5. **Index Parse:** Parses the index as a positive integer; throws an
   `InternTrackrException` for non-numeric or non-positive values.

**4.1.2 Execution Logic**

When `NoteCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It uses `ApplicationList#getApplication()` to retrieve the target application,
   which performs bounds checking automatically.
2. It calls `Application#setNote()` to update the note field, overwriting any
   previously stored note.
3. It immediately calls `Storage#save()` to persist the note to disk.
4. It displays a confirmation message via `Ui`.

The sequence diagram below shows the full flow of the `note` command:

![Note Command Sequence Diagram](images/ShyamalNoteCommandSequence.png)

**4.2 Design Considerations**

**Aspect: Overwrite vs. append behaviour**

* **Alternative 1:** Append new note content to any existing note.
  + Pros: Users can build up notes over time without retyping previous content.
  + Cons: Notes can grow uncontrollably long and become hard to manage.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Overwrite the existing note entirely.
  + Pros: Simple and predictable — the user always knows exactly what the note contains.
  + Cons: Previous note content is lost unless the user manually includes it.
  + **Reasoning:** Overwrite behaviour is simpler to implement, easier to reason about,
    and consistent with how `status` updates work. Users who want to preserve
    previous content can simply re-read the list and retype.

**Aspect: Storing note as a separate file vs. inline**

* **Alternative 1:** Store notes in a separate file indexed by application number.
  + Pros: Keeps the main data file shorter.
  + Cons: Introduces a second file to manage, complicates the storage logic,
    and breaks the single-file human-editable constraint.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Store the note inline as a pipe-delimited field.
  + Pros: Keeps all application data in one place, consistent with the existing format.
  + Cons: Notes containing the ` | ` separator could theoretically cause parsing issues,
    mitigated by using ` | ` as the delimiter and restricting notes from containing it.

### Filter, Status, Find and Clear Feature Implementation

**Author:** Emry

### 1. Filter Feature Implementation

The `filter` feature allows users to navigate large lists of applications by isolating entries that match a specific recruitment stage. It also provides a mechanism to reset the view to the full list.

#### 1.1 Implementation Details

The filter feature is implemented through a two-step process: parsing and execution. The `FilterCommandParser` first validates the input and prefix. Once created, the `FilterCommand` iterates through the `ApplicationList`, ignoring archived entries and matching the normalized status against the user's query.

**1.1.1 Parsing Logic**
The `FilterCommandParser#parse()` method handles the initial input processing:
1.  **Empty Check**: Verifies if arguments exist; otherwise, it throws an `InternTrackrException` explaining the correct usage.
2.  **Reset Detection**: Checks if the argument is exactly `clear` (case-insensitive). If so, it returns a `FilterCommand` with the `isClear` flag set to `true`.
3.  **Prefix Validation**: Ensures status-based filters start with the `s/` prefix.
4.  **Cleaning**: Extracts the status string, removes any accidental quotation marks, and trims whitespace before passing it to the command constructor.


**Transition to Execution**
The `FilterCommandParser` acts as a factory that translates raw user input into a configured `FilterCommand` object.
This object encapsulates the validated status string (or the `isClear` flag), which is then passed to the main execution loop.
This separation ensures that the `FilterCommand` itself does not need to know about the s/ prefix or raw string splitting, focusing purely on the filtering logic.

**1.1.2 Execution Logic**
When `FilterCommand#execute()` is called, it performs the following steps:
1.  **Branching**: If the `isClear` flag is active, it calls `handleClearFilter()` to display all non-archived applications.
2.  **Validation**: For status filters, it delegates verification to `Application#isValidStatus()` to ensure the input matches a recognized category: `Applied`, `Pending`, `Interview`, `Offered`, `Rejected`, or `Accepted`.
3.  **Normalization**: It retrieves the "canonical" version of the status (e.g., "iNtErViEw" becomes "Interview") via `Application#getNormalizedStatus()` to ensure a successful match.
4.  **Iteration & Archival Check**: It loops through the `ApplicationList`, first calling `Application#isArchived()` to skip any hidden entries.
5.  **Matching**: For each application, it retrieves the current status via `Application#getStatus()` and compares it with the normalized search term. If they match, the application and its current display index are passed to the `Ui` for display.
6.  **Display**: Matching applications are passed to the Ui along with their current display index.
7.  **Edge Case Handling**: If the loop completes and the `matchCount` is zero, it informs the user via `Ui`.

#### 1.2 Sequence Diagrams

The command iterates through the ApplicationList. It skips archived entries and matches the "normalized" status (Title Case) to ensure consistency.

![Filter Parsing Sequence Diagram](images/EmryFilterCommandSequence.png)

The filter command isolates applications by their current status (e.g., Applied, Interview). FilterCommandParser handles case-insensitivity and strips the s/ prefix.

![FilterCommandParser Sequence Diagram](images/EmryFilterParserSequence.png)

### 1.3 Filter State Snapshot

The following object diagram illustrates a scenario where a user filters for the "Applied" status. In this state, app1 is the only application that will be displayed because it matches the status and is not archived. app2 is excluded due to a status mismatch, and app3 is excluded because it is archived.

![Filter Object Diagram](images/EmryFilterObject.png)

#### 1.4 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Normalization vs. Literal Matching**
* **Alternative 1**: Match the user's input exactly against the stored data.
  * *Pros*: Faster execution as no string transformation is needed.
  * *Cons*: If a user types `filter s/applied` but the data is stored as `Applied`, they get zero results, which is counter-intuitive.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Normalize both the input and the comparison target to Title Case.
  * *Reasoning*: This provides a "Search-like" experience where the user does not need to remember exact capitalization, reducing friction.

**Aspect: Filtering Archived Applications**
* **Choice**: Exclude archived applications from the `filter` results.
  * *Reasoning*: This maintains consistency with the default `list` view. Users typically filter to find active tasks; historical data is kept separate in the `list archive` view to avoid cluttering the primary search results.

---

### 2. Status Feature Implementation

The `status` command allows users to update the state of an existing internship application. This is a critical component of the application lifecycle, moving entries from "Applied" toward "Offered" or "Rejected."

#### 2.1 Implementation Details

The `status` feature is handled by `StatusCommand` and `StatusCommandParser`, integrating directly with both the Model and Storage components.

**2.1.1 Parsing Logic**
The `StatusCommandParser#parse()` method breaks down the complex command string:
1.  **Delimiter Check**: It looks for the ` s/` prefix. If missing, it throws an error showing the `status INDEX s/STATUS` format.
2.  **Index Extraction**: It splits the string to isolate the index. It attempts to parse this as an `Integer`; if it fails (e.g., the user typed `status first s/...`), it throws a `NumberFormatException` caught and rethrown as an `InternTrackrException`.
3.  **Status Extraction**: It extracts the string after the `s/` prefix, trimming it for processing.

**2.1.2 Execution Logic**
The `StatusCommand#execute()` method follows a strict validation-then-update pipeline:
1.  **Dependency Assertion**: Uses Java `assert` statements to ensure `ApplicationList`, `Ui`, and `Storage` are not null.
2.  **Bounds Validation**: Checks if the provided index is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `applications.getSize()`. If out of bounds, it provides a user-friendly error message showing the valid range.
3.  **Content Validation**: Rejects empty status strings and checks against the master list of valid statuses (Applied, Pending, etc.) via `Application#isValidStatus()`.
4.  **The Update**: Retrieves the target `Application` object and updates its internal status field with the normalized string.
5.  **Immediate Persistence**: Unlike read-only commands, this command immediately calls `storage.save()`. This ensures that the progress is saved to the hard drive instantly.

#### 2.2 Sequence Diagrams

The following diagram shows the parsing logic for a status update:

![Status Parsing Sequence Diagram](images/EmryStatusLogic.png)

The diagram below illustrates how the command interacts with the Model and Storage components:

![Status Execution Sequence Diagram](images/EmryStatusCommandSequence.png)

#### 2.3 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Validation of Status Strings**
* **Alternative 1**: Allow any text as a status.
  * *Pros*: Users can create custom statuses like "Waiting for HR."
  * *Cons*: Breaks the `filter` command's ability to categorize data and risks making the storage file messy.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Use a strict whitelist of 6 valid statuses.
  * *Reasoning*: By forcing users into a specific workflow, we ensure the data remains structured enough for the `Overview` and `Filter` features to remain accurate and useful.

**Aspect: Auto-Save vs. Manual Save**
* **Choice**: Triggering `Storage#save()` automatically.
  * *Reasoning*: In a CLI environment, users often exit abruptly. Since status changes represent significant time investments (like receiving an offer), losing that update due to a crash or sudden exit is unacceptable. Auto-saving after every update prioritizes data safety.

### 3. Find Feature Implementation

The `find` feature allows users to search for specific internship applications by matching a keyword against company names and roles. This is essential for navigating large lists efficiently.

#### 3.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through the `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser` classes.

**3.1.1 Parsing Logic**
The `FindCommandParser#parse()` method processes the user input:
1.  **Trimming**: It removes leading and trailing whitespace from the argument string.
2.  **Validation**: It verifies that the resulting keyword is not empty. If it is, an `InternTrackrException` is thrown with usage instructions.
3.  **Instantiation**: It returns a new `FindCommand` object initialized with the keyword.

**3.1.2 Execution Logic**
When `FindCommand#execute()` is called:
1.  **Normalization**: The search keyword is converted to lowercase to facilitate case-insensitive matching.
2.  **Iteration and Matching**: It loops through the `ApplicationList`. For each application, it checks if the lowercase company name or lowercase role contains the keyword.
3.  **Result Aggregation**: Matching applications and their original 1-based indices are stored in temporary lists.
4.  **Display**:
  * If no matches are found, a "No matching applications found" message is displayed via the `Ui`.
  * If matches exist, the `Ui` displays each matching application preceded by its original index number from the full list.

#### 3.2 Sequence Diagrams

The diagram below shows the interaction between the Parser, Command, and Model during a find operation:

![Find Command Sequence Diagram](images/EmryFindCommandSequence.png)

#### 3.3 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Search Scope**
* **Alternative 1**: Search only company names.
  * *Pros*: Faster matching and less visual clutter.
  * *Cons*: Users often want to group applications by role type (e.g., searching "Backend") across different firms.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Search both company and role fields.
  * *Reasoning*: Maximizes utility for the user by allowing them to find applications regardless of which detail they remember.

---

### 4. Clear Feature Implementation

The `clear` command allows users to wipe all stored internship applications to reset the tracker for a new cycle.

#### 4.1 Implementation Details

The feature is handled by the `ClearCommand` class and includes a safety confirmation step.

**4.1.1 Execution Logic**
The `ClearCommand#execute()` method follows a strict confirmation-before-deletion workflow:
1.  **Confirmation Prompt**: It displays a warning asking the user to type "yes" to confirm the action.
2.  **Blocking Input**: It calls `Ui#readCommand()` to wait for the user's specific response.
3.  **Response Validation**: It checks if the response is exactly "yes" (case-insensitive and trimmed).
4.  **Data Wiping**:
  * If confirmed, it calls `applications.clear()` to empty the in-memory list.
  * It immediately invokes `storage.save()` to overwrite the data file on disk with the now-empty list.
  * A success message is displayed.
5.  **Cancellation**: If the input is not "yes", the operation is aborted, and a cancellation message is shown.

#### 4.2 Sequence Diagrams

The diagram below illustrates the confirmation loop and subsequent data clearing process:

![Clear Command Sequence Diagram](images/EmryClearCommandSequence.png)

#### 4.3 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Confirmation Mechanism**
* **Alternative 1**: Clear data immediately.
  * *Pros*: Single-step execution for power users.
  * *Cons*: Extremely high risk of accidental data loss, as the command automatically overwrites the storage file.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice)**: Two-step confirmation via a sub-prompt.
  * *Reasoning*: Given that `clear` is a destructive and relatively rare operation, prioritizing data safety over speed is the more defensive and user-friendly choice.

### Add, Delete, Parser, Archive and List Archive Feature Implementation

**Author:** Aarav

---

#### 1. Class Overview

The diagram below shows the classes involved in Aarav's features and their relationships.

![Class Diagram](images/AaravClassDiagram.png)

`Parser` acts as a pure dispatcher, delegating argument parsing to dedicated `XYZCommandParser` classes. Each command class operates on `ApplicationList`, which internally manages `Application` objects. The `isArchived` field on `Application` is the shared state that connects the archive, list, and delete workflows.

---

#### 2. Add Feature Implementation

The `add` feature allows users to create and track a new internship application by specifying the company and role.

##### 2.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through `AddCommandParser` and `AddCommand`.

**2.1.1 Parsing Logic**

The `AddCommandParser#parse()` method processes the user input as follows:

1. It checks that both the `c/` and `r/` prefixes are present.
2. It identifies the positions of the company and role prefixes, allowing either order in the user input.
3. It extracts and trims the company and role values.
4. It removes accidental quotation marks from the parsed values.
5. If either field is missing or blank, it throws an `InternTrackrException`.

**2.1.2 Execution Logic**

When `AddCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It constructs a new `Application` using the parsed company and role.
2. It checks `ApplicationList#hasApplication()` to prevent duplicate entries.
3. If a duplicate is found, it informs the user and exits without saving.
4. Otherwise, it adds the new application to the list and shows confirmation messages through `Ui`.
5. It immediately calls `Storage#save()` so the new application is persisted.

![Add Command Sequence Diagram](images/AaravAddCommandSequence.png)

##### 2.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Handling duplicate applications**

* **Alternative 1:** Allow duplicate entries.
  * *Pros:* Simpler logic and more flexibility.
  * *Cons:* Users may accidentally track the same application multiple times, making the list unreliable.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Reject duplicates before insertion.
  * *Reasoning:* This keeps the tracker clean and prevents avoidable user mistakes.

---

#### 3. Delete Feature Implementation

The `delete` feature removes an active internship application from the tracker.

##### 3.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand`.

**3.1.1 Parsing Logic**

The `DeleteCommandParser#parse()` method:

1. Verifies that an index is provided.
2. Parses the index as an integer.
3. Rejects non-numeric or non-positive values with an `InternTrackrException`.

**3.1.2 Execution Logic**

When `DeleteCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It resolves the provided index against the active (non-archived) applications only using `ApplicationList#getActiveApplication()`.
2. It retrieves the full backing list via `ApplicationList#getApplications()` and performs a linear scan by object identity to find the application's actual position in the backing list.
3. It removes the application from the backing list using `ApplicationList#deleteApplication()`.
4. It displays a confirmation message through `Ui`.
5. It immediately calls `Storage#save()` so the deletion is persisted.

This design ensures that the index used by `delete` always matches what the user sees in the default `list` output, which excludes archived applications.

![Delete Command Sequence Diagram](images/AaravDeleteCommandSequence.png)

##### 3.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Indexing archived vs active applications**

* **Alternative 1:** Delete directly by backing-list index.
  * *Pros:* Simpler internal implementation.
  * *Cons:* The index would not match the default list shown to users once archived entries exist.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Resolve the index against active applications first.
  * *Reasoning:* This keeps command behavior consistent with the visible list and reduces user confusion.

---

#### 4. Parser Implementation

The `Parser` component is responsible for dispatching raw user input to the correct command parser or command object.

##### 4.1 Implementation Details

When `Parser#parse()` is called:

1. It validates that the input is not null or blank.
2. It rejects inputs containing the `|` character to protect the storage format.
3. It splits the input into the command word and argument string.
4. It normalizes the command word to lowercase.
5. It uses a `switch` statement to route the input to the correct parser or command constructor.
6. For commands such as `add`, `delete`, and `archive`, it delegates parsing to `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, and `ArchiveCommandParser` respectively.
7. For `list`, it supports both `list` (returns `ListCommand`) and `list archive` (returns `ListArchiveCommand`). Any other argument after `list` throws an `InternTrackrException`.
8. If the command word does not match any known command, it throws an `InternTrackrException`.

Unlike `add`, `delete`, and `archive`, `list archive` does not use a dedicated parser class. Instead, `Parser` handles it directly because its parsing logic is a simple string equality check.

##### 4.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Centralized command dispatch**

* **Alternative 1:** Let each feature perform its own top-level command matching.
  * *Pros:* Each feature is more self-contained.
  * *Cons:* Command routing logic becomes duplicated and harder to maintain.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Use a centralized `Parser` dispatcher.
  * *Reasoning:* This keeps command recognition in one place and makes the overall control flow easier to understand and extend.

**Aspect: Per-command parser classes vs inline parsing**

* **Alternative 1:** Parse all commands inline inside `Parser.java`.
  * *Pros:* Fewer files and simpler project structure.
  * *Cons:* `Parser.java` grows with every new command, eventually becoming a large monolithic class that is hard to read and test.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Delegate to dedicated `XYZCommandParser` classes.
  * *Reasoning:* Keeps `Parser.java` as a thin dispatcher. Each parser class is independently testable, and adding a new command only requires a new file without modifying existing parsing logic.

**Aspect: No dedicated parser for `list archive`**

* **Alternative 1:** Introduce a separate `ListArchiveCommandParser`.
  * *Pros:* Symmetry with the other commands.
  * *Cons:* Adds another class for very little parsing logic — the check is a single `equalsIgnoreCase` call.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Handle `list archive` directly inside `Parser`.
  * *Reasoning:* Since the command only checks whether the `list` argument equals `archive`, a dedicated parser would add unnecessary complexity.

#### 5. Archive Feature Implementation

The `archive` feature allows users to hide an application from the default list while keeping it in storage.

##### 5.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through `ArchiveCommandParser` and `ArchiveCommand`.

**5.1.1 Parsing Logic**

The `ArchiveCommandParser#parse()` method:

1. Checks that an index is provided.
2. Parses the index as an integer.
3. Rejects non-numeric or non-positive values with an `InternTrackrException`.

**5.1.2 Execution Logic**

When `ArchiveCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It resolves the provided index against the active applications using `ApplicationList#getActiveApplication()`.
2. It marks the target application as archived by calling `Application#setArchived(true)`.
3. It shows confirmation output through `Ui`.
4. It immediately calls `Storage#save()` so the archived state is persisted.

Once archived, the application no longer appears in the default `list` output, but it can still be viewed with `list archive`.

##### 5.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Archive vs permanent deletion**

* **Alternative 1:** Delete rejected or inactive applications permanently.
  * *Pros:* Keeps the list short.
  * *Cons:* Users lose historical records that may still be useful for reference.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Archive applications instead of deleting them.
  * *Reasoning:* This preserves application history while keeping the active list uncluttered.

**Aspect: Storing `isArchived` in the storage file**

* **Alternative 1:** Store `isArchived` as a plain `true`/`false` field appended to the storage line.
  * *Pros:* Minimal change to the format.
  * *Cons:* Ambiguous — a deadline's `isDone` field is also stored as `true`/`false`, making it impossible for the parser to distinguish the two when the last deadline happens to be completed.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Only append `| archived:true` when the application is archived, and omit the field entirely otherwise.
  * *Reasoning:* The `archived:true` token is unambiguous and never conflicts with any other field value. Non-archived applications produce the exact same storage format as before, preserving backward compatibility with existing data files.

#### 6. List Archive Feature Implementation

The `list archive` feature displays all archived internship applications.

##### 6.1 Implementation Details

The feature is implemented through `Parser` and `ListArchiveCommand`.

`Parser` directly returns a `ListArchiveCommand` when it detects the input `list archive`.

When `ListArchiveCommand#execute()` is called:

1. It performs a first pass through the full `ApplicationList` to count archived applications.
2. If no archived applications exist, it informs the user and returns immediately.
3. Otherwise, it prints a header and performs a second pass, displaying each archived application with a sequential display index starting at 1.
4. If an archived application contains a note, the note is displayed underneath it.

This feature is read-only and does not call `Storage#save()`.

##### 6.2 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Showing archived entries in a separate view**

* **Alternative 1:** Show archived and active applications together in one list.
  * *Pros:* All data is visible in one command.
  * *Cons:* The default list becomes cluttered and less useful for active job tracking.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Keep archived entries in a separate `list archive` view.
  * *Reasoning:* This preserves historical data while keeping the primary workflow focused on active applications.

**Aspect: Two-pass vs single-pass iteration**

* **Alternative 1:** Single pass — check count and display in the same loop.
  * *Pros:* Slightly more efficient.
  * *Cons:* The header `"Here are your archived internship applications:"` would need to be printed before knowing whether there are any results, leading to an awkward header followed by an empty message.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice):** Two passes — count first, then display.
  * *Reasoning:* Ensures the header is only printed when there are actual results to show, producing cleaner output.
