# InternTrackr User Guide

InternTrackr is a CLI-first internship application manager for university students applying to many internships. It helps you track where you applied, current status, and important dates in one place so you do not miss deadlines or lose track across spreadsheets, notes, and emails.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17** or above installed.
2. Download the latest `internTrackr.jar`.
3. Copy the jar file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for Interntrackr.
4. Open a terminal, `cd` into that folder, and run:

   ```
   java -jar internTrackr.jar
   ```

   *(Optional: If you need to troubleshoot and view debug logs, append the logging flag: `java -jar internTrackr.jar --enable-logging`)*

5. Type commands and press Enter to execute.

Some commands you can try:

- `help` : Shows help.
- `add c/"Shopee" r/"Backend Intern"` : Adds a new application.
- `list` : Lists all applications.
- `list archive` : Lists all archived applications.
- `status 1 s/"Interview"` : Updates status of application 1.
- `archive 1` : Archives application 1.
- `unarchive 1` : Restores archived application 1 to the active list.
- `exit` : Exits the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details.

## Features

> **Notes about the command format:**
>
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by you.
    >   - Example: in `add c/COMPANY`, `COMPANY` can be `Shopee` or `"Shopee"` (with optional quotes).
> - Items in square brackets are optional.
    >   - Example: `deadline add ID t/TYPE d/DATE [n/NOTES]`
> - Parameters can be in any order unless stated otherwise.
> - For fields containing spaces, you may optionally wrap them in quotes `"..."` for clarity.
> - Dates use the format `DD-MM-YYYY`.
> - **CRITICAL:** Do not use the pipe character (`|`) anywhere in your inputs. It is strictly prohibited and will cause an error.
> - Extra parameters for commands that do not take parameters (such as `help`, `overview`, `exit`) will be ignored.

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the full online User Guide.

```

### Adding an application : `add`

Adds an internship application.

**Format:** `add c/COMPANY r/ROLE`

- Creates a new application with the given company and role.
- Prefixes can be provided in any order.
- Duplicate applications are not allowed. If you want to re-add an application that already exists in the archive (e.g. reapplying next cycle), please first delete the archived entry using `delete archive INDEX`, then use `add` again.
- The count shown in the confirmation message reflects only active (non-archived) applications.

**Examples:**

- `add c/"Shopee" r/"Backend Intern"`
- `add r/"Data Analyst Intern" c/"Grab Health"`

### Listing all applications : `list`

Shows a list of all tracked internship applications.
If an application has a note, it will be displayed indented on the line
directly below that application's details.

**Format:** `list`

- Only active (non-archived) applications are shown.
  Use `list archive` to view archived applications.

**Example output:**
```
Here are your internship applications:
1. Company: Shopee | Role: Backend Intern | Status: Applied | ...
   Note: Strong Java skills required, prepare LeetCode
2. Company: Grab | Role: Data Analyst | Status: Interview | ...
```

### Deleting an application : `delete`

Deletes the specified active application, or optionally an archived application directly.

**Format:** `delete INDEX` or `delete archive INDEX`

- `delete INDEX` — deletes the active application at the given `INDEX`, as shown in the default `list` output.
- `delete archive INDEX` — deletes the archived application at the given `INDEX`, as shown in the `list archive` output. This allows you to permanently remove an archived application without first unarchiving it.
- `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...

**Examples:**

- `delete 2`
- `delete archive 1`

### Updating application status : `status`

Updates the status of an existing application.

**Format:** `status INDEX s/STATUS`

- Updates the application at `INDEX`.
- `STATUS` should be one of the statuses supported (Applied, Pending, Interview, Offered, Rejected, Accepted).

**Examples:**

- `status 1 s/"Pending"`

**Example output:**
```
Status updated! Shopee is now marked as [Pending]
```

### Logging an offer : `offer`

Updates an application with an offered salary and automatically changes its status to "Offered".

**Format:** `offer INDEX s/SALARY`

- Updates the application at the given `INDEX`.
- Logs the `SALARY` for compensation tracking (must not contain more than 2 decimal places).

**Examples:**

- `offer 1 s/5000.00`
- `offer 2 s/4500`

### Archiving an application : `archive`

Archives an internship application so it no longer appears in the default active application list.

**Format:** `archive INDEX`

- Archives the application at the given `INDEX`.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the default application list.
- `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
- Archived applications are not deleted. They are hidden from the default `list` view and can still be viewed using `list archive`.

**Examples:**

- `archive 1`
- `archive 3`

### Restoring an archived application : `unarchive`

Restores an archived application back to the active list.

**Format:** `unarchive INDEX`

- Restores the application at the given `INDEX`.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the `list archive` output.
- `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
- The restored application will appear again in the default `list` output.

**Examples:**

- `unarchive 1`
- `unarchive 2`

### Listing archived applications : `list archive`

Shows all archived internship applications.

**Format:** `list archive`

- Displays only archived applications.
- Archived applications are shown using a separate index starting from 1 in the archived view.
- If an archived application has a note, the note will be displayed below it.

**Example output:**
```
Here are your archived internship applications:
1. Company: Shopee | Role: Backend Intern | Status: Rejected | ...
   Note: Rejected after OA
2. Company: Grab | Role: Data Analyst Intern | Status: Offered | ...
```

### Adding a contact : `contact`

Links recruiter or networking details to a specific internship application.

**Format:** `contact INDEX c/NAME e/EMAIL`

* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed application list.
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
* **Note:** The contact name (`c/`) must be specified before the contact email (`e/`).

**Examples:**

- `contact 1 c/"John Doe" e/"john.doe@example.com"`
- `contact 3 c/"Jane Smith HR" e/"jane.smith@shopee.com"`

### Adding a note : `note`

Adds or updates a note for a specific internship application.
Notes are useful for recording interview impressions, tech stack requirements,
or any other application-specific insights.

**Format:** `note INDEX n/NOTE_CONTENT`

- Adds or **overwrites** the existing note for the application at `INDEX`.
- `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
- `NOTE_CONTENT` can contain any text including spaces and special characters,
  except the pipe character (`|`) which is reserved for internal storage.

**Examples:**

- `note 1 n/Strong Java skills required, prepare LeetCode`
- `note 2 n/Remote friendly, good culture fit`

> **Note:** Running `note` on an application that already has a note will
> **overwrite** the previous note entirely.
> **Note:** Multi-line input is not supported. Only single-line text can be
> entered as note content.

### Filtering by status : `filter`

Shows only applications that match a given status.

**Format:** `filter s/STATUS`

**Examples:**

- `filter s/"Pending"`

**Example output:**
```
Here are the applications with status: Pending
1. Company: Shopee | Role: Backend Intern | Status: Pending | ...
```

To clear the filter:

**Format:** `filter clear`

**Example output:**
```
Filter cleared. Showing all applications:
1. Company: Shopee | Role: Backend Intern | Status: Pending | ...
2. Company: Grab | Role: Data Analyst Intern | Status: Offered | ...
```
> **Note:** The `filter` command only affects the display. For all commands that take an `INDEX`
> (e.g., `status`, `contact`, `offer`, `archive`), the index always corresponds to the position
> shown in the default `list` output, not the filtered view.
> Filtering can only be done on active applications (i.e. does not search through archived applications)

### Finding applications : `find`

Finds applications whose company name or role contains the specified keyword.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD`

* The search is case-insensitive.
* Both the company name and the role are searched.

**Examples:**
* `find Shopee`
* `find Backend Intern`

**Example output:**
```
Here are the matching applications in your list:
1. Company: Shopee | Role: Backend Intern | Status: Applied | ...
```
> **Note:** The `find` command only searches for applications containing the keyword within active applications.
> Archived applications with keyword will not appear in the output.

### Adding a deadline : `deadline add`

Adds an important deadline linked to an application.

**Format:** `deadline add INDEX t/TYPE d/DATE`

- `INDEX` refers to the application's index number shown in the default application list.
- `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
- `TYPE` describes the deadline type.
